# Calculator

This is a simple yet advanced calculator application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations along with advanced scientific functions, memory features, and a responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Features

- **Basic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Operations:** Square root, cube root, nth root, power (x^y), percentage, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan in degrees/radians), logarithms (log base 10, natural log), factorial, and absolute value.
- **Memory Functions:** Memory clear (MC), memory recall (MR), memory add (M+), and memory subtract (M-).
- **Angle Mode:** Switch between degrees (DEG) and radians (RAD) for trigonometric calculations.
- **Keyboard Support:** Full keyboard navigation for input and operations.
- **Recent Operations:** Displays a history of calculations.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile views.
- **Customizable Background:** Easily change the background image.

## How to Use

1.  **Basic Operations:** Click on number buttons and then an operator (+, -, *, /) followed by another number. Press `=` for the result.
2.  **Power (x^y):** Enter the base number, click `x^y`, then enter the exponent. Press `=` or another operator for the result.
3.  **Nth Root (n√):** Enter the root (e.g., 2 for square root), click `n√`, then enter the number to find the root of. Press `=` or another operator for the result.
4.  **Advanced Functions:** Enter a number and click the desired advanced function button (e.g., `sin`, `log`, `x!`).
5.  **Memory Functions:**
    *   `MC`: Clears the memory.
    *   `MR`: Recalls the number stored in memory to the display.
    *   `M+`: Adds the current display value to memory.
    *   `M-`: Subtracts the current display value from memory.
6.  **Angle Mode:** Click `DEG` or `RAD` to switch the angle mode for trigonometric functions.
7.  **Clear/Backspace:** Use `AC` to clear all, and `⌫` for backspace.

## Local Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nithininturi/Calculator.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
